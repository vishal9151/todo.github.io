# Todo List App Using Vanilla JavaScript

This is a simple and user-friendly Todo List application that is created using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, without relying on any external libraries. The application is part of a project that was undertaken during the Career Camp course at Coding Ninjas.

## Key Features

- Create ToDo lists with ease
- Update and delete ToDo lists as needed
- Preserve ToDo lists even after the browser is closed
- Responsive design to ensure optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices
- Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices

## Tech Stack

## What I Learned

This project helped me to understand the practical use cases of JavaScript and build a strong foundation in JavaScript development. I also learned about the local storage API and how to use it to preserve ToDo list data even after closing the browser and retrieve them when the user reopens the app.

## Installation

To install the Todo List app, use git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:imsahadeb/todolist-coding-ninjas.git
cd todolist-coding-ninjas

```
    
## Deployment
To deploy this project, simply open the index.html file in your browser.
